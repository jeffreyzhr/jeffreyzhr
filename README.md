Hey yall! I’m Jeff! I'm a Junior studying Computer Science and Economics in UC Berkeley 

Currently, I'm working on a few personal projects between classes, so feel free to reach out to collaborate. Just trying to get to grips with some CS fundementals in algorithms, data structures and basic ML through fun little projects in my spare time :)
